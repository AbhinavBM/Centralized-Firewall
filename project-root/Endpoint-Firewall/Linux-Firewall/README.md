# Endpoint Firewall Setup

This project sets up an endpoint firewall to process and inspect packets using the `endpoint_firewall.py` script.

## Steps to Use

### Step 1: Run the following commands in the terminal:
```bash
sudo chmod +x start_up.sh
sudo ./start_up.sh
```

## Important Note

- Both `start_up.sh` and `endpoint_firewall.py` **must be in the same directory**.
- **Do not change any filenames**, as the scripts are dependent on these specific names.
- Both scripts rely on the exact directory structure and filenames for correct execution.
- Ensure you have the necessary permissions to execute the scripts (use `sudo` if required).
