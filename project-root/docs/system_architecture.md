1. Overview
   The system is a multi-tier web application consisting of a frontend, backend, and a database. The frontend is built using React.js, the backend is built with Node.js and Express, and the database is a relational SQL database.

2. Components
   Frontend (React.js)
   Purpose: Provides a web-based user interface for users to interact with the system.
   Pages:
   Dashboard: Displays an overview of the system.
   Login: Allows users to log in.
   Application Management: Manages the creation, update, and deletion of applications.
   Firewall Rules: Manages firewall rules.
   Traffic Logs: Displays logs and allows for traffic analysis.
   State Management: Utilizes Redux or Context API to manage application state.
   API Interaction: Axios or fetch wrapper to interact with the backend API.
   Backend (Node.js + Express.js)
   Purpose: Handles API requests, authentication, business logic, and data management.
   Controllers:
   Auth Controller: Handles login, signup, and logout.
   Application Controller: Manages the creation, update, deletion, and retrieval of applications.
   Firewall Controller: Manages the creation, update, deletion, and retrieval of firewall rules.
   Traffic Controller: Handles traffic log retrieval and analysis.
   Middleware:
   Auth Middleware: Validates JWT tokens to secure protected routes.
   Error Middleware: Handles errors and sends uniform responses.
   Services:
   Auth Service: Handles business logic for authentication.
   Application Service: Handles application management logic.
   Firewall Service: Handles firewall rules logic.
   Traffic Service: Handles traffic logs and analysis logic.
   Database (SQL)
   Purpose: Stores data related to users, applications, firewall rules, and traffic logs.
   Tables:
   User: Stores user information and credentials.
   Application: Stores application details.
   FirewallRule: Stores firewall rules.
   TrafficLog: Stores traffic logs.
   WebSocket
   Purpose: Provides real-time communication between the server and the client for updates on traffic and firewall events.
3. Architecture Flow
   Frontend: The user interacts with the frontend UI built in React.js.
   API Requests: The frontend makes HTTP requests to the backend via RESTful API calls.
   Backend:
   The backend receives requests, processes them with the appropriate controllers and services, and returns responses.
   Protected routes are secured using JWT tokens verified by the authentication middleware.
   Database: The backend interacts with the SQL database to manage data related to users, applications, firewall rules, and traffic logs.
   WebSocket Communication: The WebSocket server manages real-time data, pushing updates to the frontend when necessary.
   This structure allows for scalable and maintainable management of authentication, firewall rules, and traffic logs.
